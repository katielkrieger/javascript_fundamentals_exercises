JavaScript History and Setup
https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/javascript/introduction-to-javascript-intro
1. ECMAScript is a standard, and JavaScript is an implementation of that standard.
2. Brendan Eich is the creator of JavaScript.
3. Option + command + j on a Mac, or right click on a web page, select Inspect and then the Console tab.

5. Prompt allows you to have the user define a variable by prompting them with some text. Example: var name = prompt("Enter your name: ").
Confirm allows you to get user confirmation through a dialog box, and assigns a boolean value to a variable according to whether the user says OK (which returns true) or Cancel (which returns false). Example: var pref = confirm("Do you want to proceed?").


Variables and Primitives Exercises
https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/javascript/introduction-to-javascript-variables-and-primitives

1. 
var name = "Katie";
var dateOfBirth = 19;
2. If you have multiple variables of the same name, the last one assigned takes precedence.
3. 
var favColor = prompt("What is your favorite color?");
console.log("Your favorite color is ",favColor,"!");
4. var quote = '"I haven\'t exercised yet today," she said';
5. null is an intentional absence of data, whereas undefined is a variable that has been created but not yet assigned.
6. NaN is shorthand for not a number. typeof(NaN) is number.
7. undefined


Boolean Logic Exercises
https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/javascript/introduction-to-javascript-boolean-exercises

Part 1
1. true
2. true
3. 1
4. true
5. false
6. true
7. true


Part 2
1. Keep it up!
2. Inside of an if statement, the value (isLearning) will be forced to a Boolean. Since isLearning was assigned to true (a truthy value), this will always be true, and we don't need a comparison operator.

1. third. firstVariable and secondVariable are both falsey values (undefined and ""), so their values inside the conditional statements are false. But thirdVariable is true. Since an || (or) operator is true when evaluating true || false, "third" is printed.
2. Undefined
3. No, undefined is a falsey
4. No, "" is a falsey
5. Yes, 1 is a truthy


Part 3
1. 
if(Math.random() > 0.5) {
	console.log("Over 0.5")
} else {
	console.log("Under 0.5")
}

2. A falsey value is not necessarily a boolean but will be coerced to false when evaluated in a boolean expression. The 6 falsey values in JavaScript are 0, "", null, undefined, false, and NaN.
